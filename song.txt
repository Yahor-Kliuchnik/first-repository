Hello world!
What a wondeful world!
Walking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
You name is unison, I'm so far away

From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feels like I'm supposed to be here

Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin' how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow, they believe in me
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am
