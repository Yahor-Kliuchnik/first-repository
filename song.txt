Hello world!
What a wondeful world!
Walking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
You name is unison, I'm so far away

From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feels like I'm supposed to be here
